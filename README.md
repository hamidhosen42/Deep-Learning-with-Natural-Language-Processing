## What is AI

- Even the most complex behaviors shown by insects are never taken into consideration when attempting to determine whether or not they are intelligent, yet everything but the simplest human behaviors are attributed to intelligence.

## Types of AI

- Types of AI (based on functionality):

   1. Reactive Machines
   2. Limited Memory
   3. Theory of Mind
   4. Self-Aware

- Types of AI (based on technology):

   1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
   2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
   3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

## What is Deep Learning

- Deep learning is a subset of AI's machine learning. Artificial intelligence lets computers replicate human behavior. Machine learning uses data-trained algorithms to do all this. Deep learning is inspired by the human brain's structure.

## Types of Deep Learning:

   1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
   2. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
   3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Difference Between ML VS DL:

   1. Feature extraction
   2. Feature selection

## How we can Understand Deep Learning easily?

- Deep learning is based on the idea of gleaning or extracting features from raw data by the application of numerous layers of analysis, each of which focuses on a distinct facet of the data that was provided as input. Convolutional networks,recurrent neural networks, and deep neural networks are examples of the several types of deep learning approaches.
